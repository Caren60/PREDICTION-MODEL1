This linear regression model predicts a dependent variable (y) based on an independent variable (x) using the equation y=mx+c, where m is the slope (coefficient) and c is the intercept. The model is trained on synthetic data with a known linear relationship and tested on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). The results are visualized to show how well the model's predictions align with the actual data.
